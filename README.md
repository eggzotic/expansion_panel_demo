# expansion_panel_demo

Flutter demo project for using ExpansionPanel and ExpansionPanelList. These
are largely a replacement for ExpansionTile, with the ability to control
the expanded/collapsed state of each tile programatically - e.g. from a button
*outside* of each panel. This could be used to provide callapse-all / expand-
all buttons, or more reactions to more sophisticated state-changes
